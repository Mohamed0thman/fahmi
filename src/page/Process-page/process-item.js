This includes  clearly communicating with the end-user and understanding their business  needs. Who are they, what are their assumptions, what are their needs, how do they use existing products in “real-life”, where do they click, what devices do they use and what are they wanting to achieve.",

With enough information gathered, I begin sketching ideas, defining task flows, and creating rough prototypes.",

The purpose at this point is to learn if I have hit the mark and solved all the necessary problems. Can users fill up tasks in a user-friendly  manner, are there any roadblocks, are there any existing pain-points? Through the data and findings, we can iterate and make adjustments accordingly.",
